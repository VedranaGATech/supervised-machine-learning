# Supervised Machine Learning Homework - Predicting Credit Risk

In this assignment, we are building a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. Specifically, you will be comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

## Instructions

1.  Retrieve the data

2.  Import the data using Pandas.

3.  Consider the models

## Fit a LogisticRegression model and RandomForestClassifier model

Create a LogisticRegression model, fit it to the data, and print the model's score. Do the same for a RandomForestClassifier.
